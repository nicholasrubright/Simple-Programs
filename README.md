# Simple Programs
This repository will contain all my small projects that I don't consider a project. Much of these are just practice programs that I may use in other projects.

Each program folder will have a `README.md` file that will describe its details.

Later on I plan to make a bunch of subfolders that contain groups of different kind of projects that showcase different skills.
