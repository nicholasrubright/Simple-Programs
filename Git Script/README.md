# Description
Since I began using Git and Github more frequently, I wanted a way to automatically move my projects from their source folder into a git repository folder. After I create a program in Visual Studios, I run this script which goes into the source folder for all my Visual Studio projects, finds the '.cpp' file under the same name as the project and copies it into a Git folder I have else where on my computer. It's a simple script that I created through trial and error. I am not too familiar with Python so the code is not the cleaniest. But I managed to scrap together a working script that does exactly what I wanted to accomplish.

# Code
I wanted some practice using Python and I don't have much experience in scripting, so I decided that Python would be a good language. I used a module called `tkinter` to create the GUI.
